# D-SERS-optophysiology
Dynamic SERS-optophysiology ToolBox

Chemometrics Toolbox for MATLab allowing the generation of optophysiological curves, barcodes extractions, sorting and counting of surface enhanced Raman spectrum acquired in a typical D-SERS-optophysiological measurement.

Some external functions, present in the code of the toolbox, must be downloaded from the corresponding reference. The references are provided in the code.
